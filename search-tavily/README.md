[LangChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest) is an open-source framework created to aid the development of applications leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs). It can be used for chatbots, text summarisation, data generation, code understanding, question answering, evaluation, and more. [Tavily](https://tavily.com/), on the other hand, is a search engine optimized for LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), aimed at efficient, quick and persistent search results.
