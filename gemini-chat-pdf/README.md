# langchain-gemini-chat-pdf
A sample Streamlit web application for generative question-answering using LangChain, Gemini and Chroma.

[LangChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest) is an open-source framework created to aid the development of applications leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs). It can be used for chatbots, text summarisation, data generation, code understanding, question answering, evaluation, and more. [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini) is a family of multimodal large language models developed by Google DeepMind, serving as the successor to LaMDA and PaLM 2. [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com), on the other hand, is an open-source, lightweight embedding (or vector) database that can be used to store embeddings locally. Together, developers can easily and quickly create AI-native applications.
